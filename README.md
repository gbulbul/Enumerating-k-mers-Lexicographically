This program was designed to achieve the task of ordering all possible strings of 2 lexicographically.  When a collection of gene strings are given, all strings of length n can be formed where n is fixed integer. Each combination of strings is expected to be written according to the lexicographical order (simply alphabetical order) as well as they need to be presented by considering lexicographical order again.
